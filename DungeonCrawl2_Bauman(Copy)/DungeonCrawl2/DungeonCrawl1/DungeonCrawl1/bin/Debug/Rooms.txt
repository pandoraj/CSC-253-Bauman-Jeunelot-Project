Outer Gates
Deep beneath the ocean waves, you stand outside the outer gates of a grand coral castle. As you look up, the sheer size is dizzying. A handful of well-armored mermen guard the gates.
Coral Courtyard
Past the gates, you're greeted with a luscious display of marine life. A beam of light illuminates a statue of a dolphin at play in the center of a wide open courtyard. It would almost be relaxing, if it wasn't for the electric eels gliding towards you...
Great Hall
You push open heavy stone doors to reveal a cavernous great hall. Supernatural light limns the walls, casting strange shadows on rows of long tables. Who knows what lies within?
Guard Barracks
Sneaking down a hallway, you enter a room lined with tidy bunks. As you pass between them, you hear a shuffling up ahead.
Armory
You flee back through the hallway and hide behind a gleaming suit of armor. A pair of guards exits the room beside you, chatting idly, and you dart in as the door closes slowly behind them. Weapons and armor line the walls, and locked chests sit on the stone floor.
